# LunoCodingChallenge

Most of the links (<a href="">Link</a>) don't work (such as: menu links, footer links, social media icons). In this code you can find a few wroking examples though, but the main idea was to make them look 'pretty'. Apart from that, everything is ready to use. 

The landing page is responsive. Style maches the Luno main website's style.

The next step would be to use SASS, and to have different scss files for each section, so the css is clean and easier to read.

Content also might be not necessarily correct, as my attention was more on the styling and less on the content.
